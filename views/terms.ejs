                        News organizations;
                        Online directory distributors may link to our Website in the same manner as they hyperlink to
                        the Websites of other listed businesses; and
                        System wide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit organizations, charity shopping
                        malls, and charity fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.

                        so long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship,
                        endorsement or approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and (c) fits
                        within the context of the linking party’s site.

                        general
                        resource information.

                        These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any way
                        deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval of the linking party
                        and its products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party’s site.
